Steps to running servers:
1) run "npm install" in PandemicModel (main folder)
2) "cd servers"
3) "node ." (in one terminal, runs index.js server)
4) "node server.js" (run second server)
5) Go to "localhost:3000" then "localhost:4000" (expect to see nothing)
6) return to terminals to see server interaction via console logs
